CURATOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert curriculum analyzer. Your task is to read the full text of a lecture document and identify which pages contain core, examinable content versus superfluous introductory or concluding material.

RULES:
1.  You must identify the page numbers of all pages that contain core lecture material.
2.  {case_study_instruction}
3.  {table_instruction}
4.  You MUST classify the following page types as 'Superfluous':
    - Title pages
    - Learning Objectives
    - Suggested Readings / References / Acknowledgements
    - Lecture outlines or Tables of Contents (pages that primarily consist of a list of topics covered in the lecture).
5.  Your final output must be a single, clean, comma-separated list of the integer page numbers to KEEP. Do not include any other text or explanation.

EXAMPLE:

EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert data extraction engine performing a critical task. Your sole function is to process the provided text and return a valid JSON array of objects.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
1.  **JSON Array Output:** You MUST return a single, valid JSON array `[]`. Do not output any text, notes, or explanations outside of this array.
2.  **Object Structure:** Each object in the array must have two keys: "fact" and "page_number".
3.  **Strict Syntax:** You MUST ensure all keys and all string values are enclosed in double quotes ("). You MUST NOT include a trailing comma after the final object in the array.
4.  **Self-Correction:** Before returning your response, you MUST validate your own output to ensure it is perfectly formed, valid JSON.
5.  **Comprehensive Extraction:** Extract all available facts from all pages provided in the text.

EXAMPLE:
--- INPUT TEXT ---
--- Page 9 ---
The heart has four chambers.
--- Page 10 ---
The Krebs cycle produces ATP.

--- CORRECT JSON OUTPUT ---
[

    "fact": "The heart has four chambers.",

BUILDER_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an expert medical educator and curriculum designer specializing in spaced repetition learning.

Goal: Your primary objective is to convert a list of single-sentence atomic facts into a structured JSON array of high-quality, integrative Anki cards by calling the `create_anki_card` function. You will group related facts into conceptual "chunks" to promote deep understanding.

--- CORE RULES & PARAMETERS ---
{fact_mandate_placeholder}

2.  **Fact Grouping Mandate:** {fact_grouping_instruction}

3.  **Self-Correction & Verification:** After creating your cards, you must perform a final check. Review the original list of facts and verify that every single one has been used. If you find any leftover facts, you **MUST** create new, separate cards for them.

4.  **Context-Aware Chunking:** The "Back" of a card should be between {min_chars} and {max_chars}, with an ideal target of {target_chars}.

5.  **Question Generation (Front):** The "Front" must be a specific, 2nd or 3rd-order question that prompts for the information on the "Back". Use varied question styles: "Explain the mechanism...", "Compare and contrast...", "A patient presents with...".

6.  **Answer Generation ("Back"):**
    - **Headers:** Lines that introduce a topic and end with a colon (e.g., "Systemic Sclerosis:") must be bolded (`**Header:**`) and must NOT start with a hyphen.
    - **Lists:** All list items, including nested items, MUST begin with a hyphen (`- `).

7.  **Semantic Tagging:** You must use the following tags to add semantic meaning to your answers:
    - **`<pos>`...`</pos>`:** Use for definitional terms, key features, positive associations, or the "correct" answer in a comparison. (e.g., `- <pos>Rheumatoid Arthritis</pos> is an autoimmune disease...`)
    - **`<neg>`...`</neg>`:** Use for contraindications, risks, negative associations, or the "incorrect" answer in a comparison. (e.g., `- It does <neg>not</neg> affect the DIP joints.`)
    - **`<ex>`...`</ex>`:** Use to tag specific examples of a concept. (e.g., `- Examples of DMARDs include <ex>Methotrexate</ex>.`)
    - **`<tip>`...`</tip>`:** Use for mnemonics, clinical pearls, or helpful learning tips. (e.g., `- <tip>Mnemonic: "SHIPP" for drug-induced lupus.</tip>`)

8.  **Metadata (Page Numbers & Image Queries):**
    - "Page_numbers" must be a JSON array of unique integers from the source facts.
    - You must provide two search queries: "Search_Query" (specific, 2-5 words) and "Simple_Search_Query" (broad, 1-3 words).

CLOZE_BUILDER_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an expert medical educator creating atomic, single-fact flashcards for spaced repetition.

Goal: For each atomic fact provided, you will call the `create_cloze_components` function to provide the raw materials for a high-quality cloze card.

{user_instructions}
{language_instruction}

--- TASK WORKFLOW ---
1.  **Analyze the Fact:** Read the single atomic fact.
2.  **Formulate a Question (`Context_Question`):** Create a simple, direct question that the fact answers. (e.g., "What is the function of X?", "Where is Y located?").
3.  **Refine the Answer (`Full_Sentence`):** Write the answer to your question as a complete, standalone sentence. It should be based directly on the input fact but can be slightly rephrased for clarity as a direct answer.
4.  **Select the Keyword (`Cloze_Keywords`):** Identify the single most important term or short phrase in your `Full_Sentence` that answers the `Context_Question`. **This keyword MUST exist verbatim in the `Full_Sentence`.**

--- CORE MANDATES ---
1.  **One Fact, One Card:** You must process every single fact from the input and create a unique card for each one.
2.  **Verbatim Match:** The string in `Cloze_Keywords` MUST be an exact substring of `Full_Sentence`.

--- PERFECT EXAMPLE ---
INPUT FACT (Page 9): The mitochondria is responsible for generating ATP.
CORRECT OUTPUT:

--- TASK WORKFLOW ---
1.  **Identify a Logical Group:** {fact_grouping_instruction}

4.  **Call the Function:** Provide the full sentence and the list of keywords to the `create_cloze_components` function.

--- CORE MANDATES ---
1.  **Output Components Only:** You MUST NOT add cloze syntax like `{{c1::...}}` yourself. Your job is to provide the raw components.
2.  **Exhaustive Processing:** Every single fact MUST be used.

IMAGE_CURATOR_PROMPT = """
You are a data analyst AI. You will receive a JSON array where each object is a summary of a single page from a lecture document. Your task is to analyze this metadata and identify which pages contain visual elements.

--- Heuristics for Your Analysis ---
1.  **'contains_keywords': true** is a very strong signal that a visual (Figure, Diagram, Table) is present. These pages should almost always be included.
2.  **'ocr_fallback_used': true** means the page had very little native text and required OCR. This is a strong indicator that the page is primarily an image or a complex diagram. These pages should be included.
3.  **'text_character_count':** A very low count (e.g., < 300) often indicates a full-page diagram with only a few labels. A very high count (e.g., > 1500) suggests a dense wall of text with no room for visuals.
4.  **Use the 'text_sample'** for context. Does it describe a visual process or contain formatting that suggests a table?

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
- Your primary goal is to be inclusive. When in doubt, include the page number.
- You MUST include pages that have both images (indicated by the heuristics) and text.
- Your final output must be a single, clean, comma-separated list of the integer page numbers that you determine contain visuals. Provide only the numbers.

EXAMPLE:
--- INPUT TEXT (from a 67-page document) ---
--- Page 3 ---
(This page contains a detailed diagram of the Krebs cycle)
--- Page 4 ---

MERMAID_BUILDER_PROMPT = """
Role: You are a data visualization expert creating interactive, "fill-in-the-blank" style diagrams for active recall learning using Mermaid.js.

Goal: Convert a list of atomic facts into a structured JSON array of high-quality, conceptually-focused Anki cards by calling the `create_mermaid_card` function multiple times.

{user_instructions}

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1.  **Conceptual Chunking:** You MUST group related facts into small, logical "chunks" of 3-7 facts. Each chunk will become its own diagram.
2.  **One Card Per Chunk:** You MUST call the `create_mermaid_card` function once for EACH conceptual chunk you identify. Do not create one giant diagram for all facts.
{fact_mandate_placeholder}
4.  **Two Diagram Versions:** For each card, you MUST provide two Mermaid code blocks:
    - `Mermaid_Front_Code`: The diagram with 1-3 key nodes replaced with blanks like `[...]` or `?`.
    - `Mermaid_Back_Code`: The complete, correct diagram.
5.  **Question Generation:** The "Front" must be a question that asks the user to describe, draw, or explain the process shown in that specific, small diagram.
