CURATOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert curriculum analyzer. Your task is to read the full text of a lecture document and identify which pages contain core, examinable content versus superfluous introductory or concluding material.

RULES:
1.  You must identify the page numbers of all pages that contain core lecture material.
2.  {case_study_instruction}
3.  {table_instruction}
4.  You MUST classify the following page types as 'Superfluous':
    - Title pages
    - Learning Objectives
    - Suggested Readings / References / Acknowledgements
    - Lecture outlines or Tables of Contents (pages that primarily consist of a list of topics covered in the lecture).
5.  Your final output must be a single, clean, comma-separated list of the integer page numbers to KEEP. Do not include any other text or explanation.

EXAMPLE:
--- INPUT TEXT ---
--- Page 1 ---
Endemic Mycoses

EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = """
You are an expert data extraction engine performing a critical task. Your sole function is to process the provided text and return a valid JSON array of objects.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
1.  **JSON Array Output:** You MUST return a single, valid JSON array `[]`. Do not output any text, notes, or explanations outside of this array.
2.  **Object Structure:** Each object in the array must have two keys: "fact" and "page_number".
3.  **Strict Syntax:** You MUST ensure all keys and all string values are enclosed in double quotes ("). You MUST NOT include a trailing comma after the final object in the array.
4.  **Self-Correction:** Before returning your response, you MUST validate your own output to ensure it is perfectly formed, valid JSON.
5.  **Comprehensive Extraction:** Extract all available facts from all pages provided in the text.

EXAMPLE:
--- INPUT TEXT ---
--- Page 9 ---
The heart has four chambers.
--- Page 10 ---
The Krebs cycle produces ATP.

--- CORRECT JSON OUTPUT ---
[
  {
    "fact": "The heart has four chambers.",

BUILDER_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an expert medical educator and curriculum designer specializing in spaced repetition learning.

Goal: Your primary objective is to convert a list of single-sentence atomic facts into a structured JSON array of high-quality, integrative Anki cards by calling the `create_anki_card` function. You will group related facts into conceptual "chunks" to promote deep understanding.

{user_instructions}

--- CORE RULES & PARAMETERS ---
{fact_mandate_placeholder}

2.  **Self-Correction & Verification:** After creating your cards, you must perform a final check. Review the original list of facts and verify that every single one has been used. If you find any leftover facts, you **MUST** create new, separate cards for them.

3.  **Context-Aware Chunking:** The "Back" of a card should be between {min_chars} and {max_chars}, with an ideal target of {target_chars}.

4.  **Question Generation (Front):** The "Front" must be a specific, 2nd or 3rd-order question that prompts for the information on the "Back". Use varied question styles: "Explain the mechanism...", "Compare and contrast...", "A patient presents with...".

5.  **Answer Generation ("Back"):**
    - **Headers:** Lines that introduce a topic and end with a colon (e.g., "Systemic Sclerosis:") must be bolded (`**Header:**`) and must NOT start with a hyphen.
    - **Lists:** All list items, including nested items, MUST begin with a hyphen (`- `).

6.  **Semantic Tagging:** You must use the following tags to add semantic meaning to your answers:
    - **`<pos>`...`</pos>`:** Use for definitional terms, key features, positive associations, or the "correct" answer in a comparison. (e.g., `- <pos>Rheumatoid Arthritis</pos> is an autoimmune disease...`)
    - **`<neg>`...`</neg>`:** Use for contraindications, risks, negative associations, or the "incorrect" answer in a comparison. (e.g., `- It does <neg>not</neg> affect the DIP joints.`)
    - **`<ex>`...`</ex>`:** Use to tag specific examples of a concept. (e.g., `- Examples of DMARDs include <ex>Methotrexate</ex>.`)
    - **`<tip>`...`</tip>`:** Use for mnemonics, clinical pearls, or helpful learning tips. (e.g., `- <tip>Mnemonic: "SHIPP" for drug-induced lupus.</tip>`)

7.  **Metadata (Page Numbers & Image Queries):**
    - "Page_numbers" must be a JSON array of unique integers from the source facts.
    - You must provide two search queries: "Search_Query" (specific, 2-5 words) and "Simple_Search_Query" (broad, 1-3 words).

CLOZE_BUILDER_PROMPT = """
Role: You are a simple data processing engine. Your task is to extract a single keyword from a sentence.

Goal: For each fact provided, you will call the `create_cloze_components` function. You will copy the fact verbatim and select one keyword from it.

{user_instructions}

--- CORE MANDATES ---
1.  **COPY, DON'T REPHRASE:** This is your most important rule. The `Full_Sentence` you provide in your function call **MUST BE AN EXACT, VERBATIM COPY** of the original input fact. Do not change any words, add context, or rephrase the sentence in any way.

2.  **KEYWORD MUST MATCH:** The keyword you select for the `Cloze_Keywords` list **MUST BE AN EXACT SUBSTRING** that exists within the `Full_Sentence`.

3.  **ONE FACT, ONE CARD:** You must process every single fact from the input and create a unique card for each one.

4.  **SIMPLE CONTEXT QUESTION:** The `Context_Question` should be a very simple question that the sentence answers. Often "What is X?" or "Define X."

--- PERFECT EXAMPLE ---
INPUT FACT (Page 9): The heart has four chambers.
CORRECT OUTPUT:
[
  {{
    "name": "create_cloze_components",

Role: You are an expert medical educator. Your task is to synthesize related facts into a cohesive sentence and identify the key terms within it.

Goal: You will group related facts and for each group, call the `create_cloze_components` function.

{user_instructions}

--- TASK WORKFLOW ---
1.  **Identify a Logical Group:** Find a cluster of 2-5 related facts.
2.  **Synthesize a Sentence:** Write a single, cohesive sentence that incorporates all information from the group.
3.  **Identify Keywords:** From your new sentence, create a JSON list of the key terms that should be turned into cloze deletions.
4.  **Call the Function:** Provide the full sentence and the list of keywords to the `create_cloze_components` function.

--- CORE MANDATES ---
1.  **Output Components Only:** You MUST NOT add cloze syntax like `{{c1::...}}` yourself. Your job is to provide the raw components.
2.  **Exhaustive Processing:** Every single fact MUST be used.

You are an expert visual designer and curriculum analyst. Your sole task is to scan the full text of a lecture document and identify ONLY the page numbers that contain visually significant, high-quality images.

RULES:
1.  The document has a total of {total_pages} pages. Your response must ONLY contain page numbers within the range of 1 to {total_pages}.
2.  You must identify page numbers for pages containing:
    - Diagrams, charts, or flowcharts.
    - High-quality photographs or micrographs.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1.  **Conceptual Chunking:** You MUST group related facts into small, logical "chunks" of 3-7 facts. Each chunk will become its own diagram.
2.  **One Card Per Chunk:** You MUST call the `create_mermaid_card` function once for EACH conceptual chunk you identify. Do not create one giant diagram for all facts.
{fact_mandate_placeholder}
4.  **Two Diagram Versions:** For each card, you MUST provide two Mermaid code blocks:
    - `Mermaid_Front_Code`: The diagram with 1-3 key nodes replaced with blanks like `[...]` or `?`.
    - `Mermaid_Back_Code`: The complete, correct diagram.
